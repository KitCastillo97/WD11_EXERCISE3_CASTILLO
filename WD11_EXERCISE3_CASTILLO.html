            <p> 
                Located in the heart of Mindanao is the City of Valencia in the Province of Bukidnon. With its hills and plains rich in natural resources, the brisk trade and the rich harvest from the various farms, it is considered as the agri-tourism capital ofthe province of Bukidnon.
                Valencia City is a warm, lovely, and always welcoming city. It is home to almost 200,000 people distributed in about 40,000 households spread over a land area of approximately 100,000 hectares. This makes Valencia City the local government unit serving the greatest number of people in the province.
                Nestled among the hills of Bukidnon, at the valley in the shadows of both the Mt. Kalatungan and Mt. Kitanglad mountain ranges, Valencia City is a vast plain traversed by the mighty Pulangi River. Once navigated only with bamboo rafts locally called ‘gakit’, the Pulangi River made Valencia the center of trade in the old days. The gakits were loaded with produce like abaca and coffee from the northern parts of the province and were floated down the river to the dock in Valencia. The goods were exchanged with salt, fabric for clothing, and the like. The plains of Valencia used to be a vast pasture land for the cattle country that was Bukidnon. Now the old pasture lands, collectively called Valencia Plains, yield the best tasting, nationally famous Valencia rice. This rice variety is produced with the blessing of the Pulangi River, the powerful source of water for the vast irrigation system needed for the plains.

            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
                The territory that now comprises the city of Valencia were the former thirteen barangays of the City of Malaybalay, Bukidnon.
                The earliest inhabitants in the area presently comprising part of the Poblacion were Bukidnon natives who founded a settlement along the banks of Pulangi River and the confluence of the Panglibatuhan River. The pioneers were led by Datu Sebastian Manangkila together with the families of the Binalhays, Laugas, Dongogans, Gua-ans, Lanayans, and the Arenzos. The first site of the settlement was a sitio named “Panglibatuhan” because the area was thickly forested by tree species called by the natives as “Malibato trees”. In 1911, on-room barrio school was opened, and its first teacher was the late Leon Galorport. That school site is approximately the present location of the Poblacion Barangay High School. Galorport, who came from his hometown, Valencia, Bohol named the school “Valencia School”. When the sitio became a barrio of Malaybalay, the resident agreed to name it “Valencia”. Finally, when the southern portion of Malaybalay was separated as a new municipality, the petitioners agreed to name the municipality as “Valencia”. The barrio which was Valencia is now Barangay Poblacion and is the seat of the city government of Valencia.
                The rich natural resources found in the territory eventually attracted Christian settlers from the highly populated coastal areas of Mindanao, Visayas and Luzon islands. Immigration of Christian settlers to the area started in the middle 1930’s. During the Second World War, the continued migration of Christian settlers further increased the population of the area from 13,898 in 1960 to 64,541 in 1975. The population grew to 181,556, according to the latest census conducted by the National Statistics Office in 2010.
